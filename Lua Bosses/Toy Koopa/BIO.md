This is Toy Koopa based on one of the boss sprite submissions in the C3 Museum threads. It walks around, following Mario, and occasionally stops to shoot Bullet Bills. After it takes damage, it goes into its shell, and rams into a wall. To defeat it, jump on it when it shoots Bullet Bills. An additional behavior is made for it to start ramming into a wall outside of taking damage and spin around the arena, shooting Bullet Bills on different sides with RNG decision. If the Toy Koopa starts to ram attack or spin attack, it's guarantee for its decision to stop and shoot Bullet Bills. Its shell will be protected to any attacks. The player can jump on it when it shoots bullet bills. When it's not in its shell, it's susceptible to sword attacks, fireballs, SML DamageSystem by support, strong attacks, and Wario's attacks by support; however, groundpounds and spinjumps will not damage it when its spikes are revealed and instead hurt the players.
