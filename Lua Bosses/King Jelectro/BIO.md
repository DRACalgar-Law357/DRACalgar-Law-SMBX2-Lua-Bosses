This is King Jelectro from Super Mario World Central Production 2.

It is the main boss of World 4. This may have no direct affairs with the main antagonist of SMWCP2, Norveg, and his company, Norveg Industries, that pursues industrialization throughout the Mushroom Kingdom. Other unlikely bosses, Fiora from World 2 and Youko (Nameless Tanuki) from World 3, do have some affairs with Norveg such as when Fiora has to make sure that the toxic swamp does not interfere with Norveg Industries's operations in the forest. It lies within Stone Sea Sanctuary, a sea dungeon filled with thwomps, thwimps, jelectros, a few fishes, and a gimmick of a torpedo that the player can use to traverse the waters with ease. It was supposed to have a crown but it didn't for the boss fight.

Before the fight is started, an intro sequence may be played. In idle state, it starts one of the attacks: briefly chase the player, shoot lightning horizontally or vertically, swim out of the screen and either skim around the screen while shooting lightning or swim around the screen, and charge at the player. It takes 18 fireballs or 3 strong hits or 3 hits strucked by spike blocks to get defeated by default. A config
