description = "A boss that occasionally does the following attacks based on its amount of health points: shoot rinkas, shoot explosive fireballs, shoot scorching fireballs, slam down and continuously shoot fire, try to burn and chase the player, shoot a barrage of fireballs, shoot a barrage of Volcano Lotus Spores, spout small fireballs, and slam down at the player while creating shockwaves. Its kamikaze attack, Spinning Hell, will have it stay in place while shooting fire projectiles like if it were a fountain firework. It'd usually take 12 strong hits to defeat it by default."
