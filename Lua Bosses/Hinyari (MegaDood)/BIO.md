This boss is Hinyari, also known as Penguin, from Wario Land 1. At start, he doesn't wear his helmet until he has been hit in which indicates to players that they must jump on Hinyari's head and need to remove his helmet that protects him. He usually goes around and punching stuff with his gloves. Whenever he's been damaged, he jumps down and then back up with his new helmet. As MegaDood makes him, he'll add hitboxes to accomodate certain scenarios Hinyari gets hit and also add interactions in which Hinyari can activate ice blocks, shells, and certain items by punching them.
