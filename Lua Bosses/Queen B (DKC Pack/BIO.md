This is the Queen B boss from Donkey Kong Country that'll donated to MegaDood's "Donkey Kong NPCs" NPC pack. Created by DRACalgar Law with some help by HengShao, kindly enough to lend some GFX sprites that I imported and assembled, and MegaDood, who helped me with some codes.

This is a large Zinger that flys around the player. Depending on it configurations, it can summon Zingers to protect it and/or shoot horns. Takes <u>5 stomps</u> or <u>5 strong projectiles</u> to defeat. Each set of hits makes it more aggresive.
