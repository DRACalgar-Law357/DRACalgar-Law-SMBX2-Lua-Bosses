Updated Bankirosu due to its animation system incompatible with the B5 in some way. So, I ended up fixing it and improving it.
It interacts with blocks, properly ricochets around the arena, and gets damaged by fireballs. Replaced its frame system, which animated freaky animations in B5, to its modern system.
