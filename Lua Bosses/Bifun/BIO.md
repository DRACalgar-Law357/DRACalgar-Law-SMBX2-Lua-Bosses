This is Bifun, also known as Minotaur, from Wario Land 1. He starts with an intro sequence and starts running around, attempting to grab the player and throw them out. If he's on the cliff, he'll turn around and jump. When he gets jumped on or hit by strong attacks, he gets stunned and can be thrown into the lava to defeat him. But, I decide to make extra settings in which Bifun can take more hits from the lava. If that were the case, he'd be blown all the way up to the screen and then back to his set position, causing the player to stun if they were on the ground. I also decided to make his pinch sequence where Bifun chases the player to make this boss innovative.
