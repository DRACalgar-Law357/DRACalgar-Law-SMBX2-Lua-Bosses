These are Skuttlers and Skuttler Cannoneers from Kid Icarus: Uprising. These baddies patrol around the area and attack players who they stumble upon. Regular Skuttlers use their bone clubs to melee attack players horizontally or vertically. Skuttler Cannoneers shoot projectiles at the player in an aiming angle. If the cannoneers are set to dontMove, they'll periodically shoot projectiles.
